            <div class="cd-faq-content">
              <p>
                Patranous Bank Chip Credit Cards come with an embedded micro
                chip which provides additional security against counterfeiting /
                duplication of the card. It also provides an extra layer of
                security in the form of a Personal Identification Number (PIN).
                You will be required to enter your 4-digit PIN on the terminal
                for transactions at merchant outlets.

              <p>
                LNo. There is no fee for using your debit card for retail or
                online transactions. However, under certain merchant categories
                like railways and fuel, a fee may be levied by the merchant on
                every purchase.

              <p>
                LFor security reasons, your debit card will be blocked if there
                are 3 consecutive wrong PIN attempts on the account. However,
                the card will be activated automatically after 12:00 a.m. and
                you can access it there on.<br />

                If you forgot the debit card PIN, please follow the below steps
                to generate the new PIN.<br />

            <div class="cd-faq-content">
              <p>
                MCLR stands for Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate. MCLR
                is the benchmark rate below which the banks cannot provide loans
                to the customers who are availing loans linked to MCLR. This new
                benchmark rate is applicable for new loans sanctioned from April
                1, 2016 onwards.
